Project name: Solar System

General Work: (Work has been discussed and decided together)
	+ Making a general object and features for every plannet
	+ Making a namespace for project: suggestions -- solarsystem -- universal
	+ Making a class that will be inheritanced from other small classes: Plannet
	+ Making plannet-classes that will inheritance from the Plannet class which
	will have all properties of the plannet.

	+ List of plannets:
		- Sun
		- Mercury
		- Venus
		- Earth
		- Mars
		- Jupiter
		- Saturn
		- Uranus
		- Neptune

	+ General variables for each plannet:
		*** For 2D Project
		- double: Radius (size)
		- double: Distance away from Sun
		- double: Orbit Velocity
		- 2DTexture for Plannet
		- Sprite for Plannet
		- Circle around the sun (how the plannet moves around the sun)

		*** For 3D Project
		- double: Radius (size)
		- double: Eclipse width and Eclipse height
		- double: Orbit Velocity
		- 2DTexture
		- Sprite
		- Eclipse around the sun (how the plannet moves around the sun)
