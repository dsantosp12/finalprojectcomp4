 *  Indicate which parts you think are working, and describe

General Work: (Work has been discussed and decided together)
	+ Making a general object and features for every planet
	+ Making a namespace for project: suggestions -- solarsystem -- universal
	+ Making a class that will be inheritances from other small classes: Planet
	+ Making planet-classes that will inheritance from the Planet class which
	will have all properties of the planet.

	+ List of planets:
		- Sun
		- Mercury
		- Venus
		- Earth
		- Mars

	+ General variables for each planet:
		*** For 2D Project
		- double: Radius (size)
		- double: Distance away from Sun
		- double: Orbit Velocity
		- 2DTexture for Plannet
		- Sprite for Plannet
		- Circle around the sun (how the planet moves around the sun)

	+ General functions:
		- Draw stars on the screen
		- Draw Solar system on the screen

	+ Functions for each Planet:
		- Getters and Setters for each variables
		- Draw functions (extends from SFML class Drawable)
		- getVelocity (object Planet) -- Gets Velocity
		- getSize(int radius)  -- Gets size of each planet

	+ Extra Credits Features:
		- Making a spaceship moving around the universe
		- Clicking on any planet will display a table at the corner of the screen
		  which shows the information of the current space (velocity, coodinate, name, acceleration)...

Initial Splited Works:

Author: Hung Q Nguyen
	+ Making Initial Objects of planets and its features (movements ...)
	+ Working on Body class

Author: Daniel Santos
	+ Working on SpaceObject and Stars

Together:
	+ We work on the Universe class and Unit Testing together.

Final report:
	As we splitted the work, but in any cases that we need to have any additional
functions in any class, we could make it without any decision as long as that function
does not give any troubles to the program itself.
	The plan goes our way and the process is successfully finished.

- The solar system works, for all the basic part and the extra credits parts.
- The assignment is completely finished
- The complete part of the system includes:
	+ The basic solar system itself with 5 planets inlcuded the sun
	+ Stars are drawed in the background
	+ A spaceship that is moving around and controlled by keyboards
	+ Also, when any planet is clicked, a dialog will display the planet's
properties.

/**********************************************************************
 *  List whatever help (if any) you received from lab TAs,
 *  classmates, or anyone else.
 **********************************************************************/
- Me and Daniel discussed and did the final projects together.
- We research and study from material online and C++ books.

/**********************************************************************
 *  Problems during the period                                   
 **********************************************************************/
- We did not face any serious problem at all.
- Sometime we didn't understand the process pretty much, after discussion,
every goes through.
